## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  
I definitely do not take enough breaks, and I am making it a habit to use the marinara timer.  It's a great application that holds me accountable so I *make* myself takes breaks now. I also try to read a lot, although when school starts I may not have as much time.  My goal is to shut down all electronics and read for 15-20 minutes before bed while in school.  Teaching others is a great way to make something stick in your brain, and I will have to find study partners to talk things out after we learn something.  I would probably add improving your learning enviornment to the list, free of distractions.  Move your phone with social media on it *across* the room.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.  
Numbers: can be floats or integers, don't need quotation marks  
Booleans: true or false statements, need to be lowercased and don't need quotation marks  
Strings: can be any type of character as long as it's within quotation marks  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?  
var sentence = "Hello World!"  
console.log(sentence)  

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?  
You can either do this by typing // before your comment or writing your comment like this: /* comment */  
Sometimes you need to be more descriptive about your code for other coders to see, so comments can be helpful.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?  
Variables allow us to place value to a thing, and then we can reassign the value throughout our coding.  

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?  
Noracooks.com is a website for vegan recipes.   Each recipe that gets posted has a time assigned to it for prep time and for cook time.  The website allows you to sort recipes based on how long it takes to prep and cook.  The website could then use a boolean to lump a recipe with others if the prep and cook time is <30 minutes.  
They use strings for recipe names, which changes for reach recipe.  
Some recipes let you double the amount of services, so it would double the ingredients for you.  So the variable would be the ingredients and the numbers associated with them would be doubled.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.  
It's a way to combine different variables into the same expression.  You can combine them to form sentences.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?  
Perhaps a travel website may use this, like Airbnb.  If you want to reserve a cabin or house for a vacation, and you type in 5 guests within this time frame in this city, the website can combine all the variable values that you assigned and come up with available options that meet that criteria for you.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  
Boolean statements! They will always be achilles heel! I think there's a typo in the dataTypes.js file, otherwise I *really* don't understand boolean statements.  But what's the difference between == and ===? The examples had === but I thought booleans were ==, unless == is true and === is false.  I don't know why I can't understand them!
